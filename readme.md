# headless-cat-n-mouse

[🐈 Meet the cat](http://antoinevastel.github.io/bot%20detection/2018/01/17/detect-chrome-headless-v2.html). 
[🐁 Meet the mouse](https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/).

This repo hosts this [arms race](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16179602) with both [detections](./detect-headless.js) and [evasions](./apply-evasions.js).


**repo status:**: `Headless detection *succeeded*. 🔍  Detectors are winning!`

---------------

_2021 update_: This repo has mostly calmed down. There's still a cat-n-mouse game going on in the wild, but there's not much incentive for either side to open-source their efforts. :)
